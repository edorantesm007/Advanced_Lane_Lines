# Advanced_Lane_Lines
In this project, the goal is to write a software pipeline to identify the lane boundaries in a video from a front-facing camera on a car. 

Python, OpenCV and Jupyter notebook are required. 

Note: There are two main files for the program the first is named “Advanced Lane Lines Pruebas” and the second is named “Advanced_Lane_LinesG1”. The first contains all the code required to produce an image with the desire characteristics and code to plot images. The second code is equal to the first except that all the print commands and plot commands were eliminated in order to make the code more readable.
