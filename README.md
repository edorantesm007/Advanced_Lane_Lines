# Advanced_Lane_Lines
The code reads images from a video stream and finds the lane lines in the road

Note: There are two main files for the program the first is named “Advanced Lane Lines Pruebas” and the second is named “Advanced_Lane_LinesG1”. The first contains all the code required to produce an image with the desire characteristics and code to plot images. The second code is equal to the first except that all the print commands and plot commands were eliminated in order to make the code more readable.
